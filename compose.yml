# Example Docker Compose file
# ===========================================================================
#
# Purpose:
# --------
#
# This file is an example Docker Compose configuration for self hosting
# Maybe on your local machine or on a cloud VPS.
#
# The configuration below is a "standard" setup that works out of the box,
# but if you're running this outside of a local network, it is recommended
# to set the environment variables for extra security.
#
# Setup:
# ------
#
# To run this, you should read the setup guide:
#
# https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/blob/main/docs/hosting/docker.md
#
# Troubleshooting:
# ----------------
#
# If you run into problems, you should open a Discussion here:
